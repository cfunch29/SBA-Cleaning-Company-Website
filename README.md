Really want to have the ability to create these sites myself from scratch since all the other platforms charge a premium to host and connect your domain. I enjoy making websites and really want to enhance my skill level.

### Reflection
---

`What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?` I don't think the planning was terrible since I was just trying to replicate a site I've already done on a platform. I think with more practice the concepts will become easier. 

`Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?` I struggled the most with flexbox properties but I did use flexbox froggy to practice. It will become easier with more practice

`What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?`
I would have added an additonal or section for a column cards for the services. I think I would have also made the site more visually appealing. I kept the design very simple but it could've been more complex if I had the time.
